# Machine Learning in Python part 2: Classification
This is a repository for Sydney Informatics Hub's lesson materials for the "Introduction to Machine Learning using Python" workshops.

## Setup requirements

In this workshop we’re using Google Colab to modify and run Python code provided in a Jupyter notebook to illustrate the concepts of EDA. You will require a Google account to access Colab.

### How to access Colab and load the notebook

1.	Open a browser and navigate to https://colab.research.google.com/;

2.	Use the blue sign in button on the top right of the screen to sign into your Google account;

  - Paste this URL <https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/lessons-mlpy-part2> into the box provided for GitHub URLs. 

  - Click the search symbol. Additional information about the repository and paths will appear.

  - In the Path section, click on `02-Classification-Exercises.ipynb` to open the notebook.

Note: if you get pop ups that prompt you to give GitHub permissions, close the popup window and untick the option ‘*include private repos*’.

5.	*[Optional but recommended]*. Save a copy of the notebook to your drive using the ‘Copy to Drive’ button. This is necessary if you want to save any changes you make to the code during the workshop.
